Designed and implemented a 4D Pattern Recognition Classifier- Baysian Classifier using Maximum Likelihood Technique.
Since its a Baysian Classifier, parameters used are only Mean and Covariance. These parameters are determined from a
training set of known classes(train_sp2015_v14). After that the classifiers are tested using a test set(test_sp2015_v14).
The probability of error using this classifier is given by, P(Error) = 0.17.

The result of the classification on the test data can be found in the Classification file included within this 
directory. I have also included a report on the project in this directory. For a more in-depth discussion please
